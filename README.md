======================

Simple toolkit/package that enables seamless AJAX based communication between the client and server backend

### Recommended Plugins
By default our javascript uses the HTML5 API to manipulate the clients history to support browsers that don't follow this API use the (History.js)[https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/) jQuery plugin. If this plugin is loaded our code will automatically use it instead of the HTML5 history API.
